Denver police have been confronting a growing crisis that has now extended to the airport 25 miles outside the city's core, where bathrooms and warm cover provide refuge for those experiencing homelessness.

9Wants to Know analyzed arrest data from the Denver Police Department obtained through a records request and found 30 people have been repeatedly arrested for trespassing over the last three years.

The findings were used in the story that was published on February 6, 2022: https://www.9news.com/article/news/investigations/homeless-crisis-denver-airport/73-096826a3-658f-4036-a3d3-83bba7fda134

# Author's note: This code has been partially redacted to remove names.
  # This is because: 9NEWS has chosen not to fully identify the people experiencing homelessness in this story because advocates say they are in a constant state of crisis and doing so would perpetuate a cycle preventing them from seeking gainful employment.
  # Removed columns: "arrestee_name" and "dob."
